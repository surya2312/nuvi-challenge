# Nuvi interview code project

This is the code for visualizing and interacting with social media activities, 
such as tweets, Facebook posts, and Instagram posts.

The data is fetched from restful service https://nuvi-challenge.herokuapp.com/activities

My choice of javascript framework is Angular2 with Typescript.
I have also used PrimeNG to show datatable and Pie chart, to easily visualize the data.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.   

## Install npm packages


Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:
```bash
npm install
```

## To run the application

npm start

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
